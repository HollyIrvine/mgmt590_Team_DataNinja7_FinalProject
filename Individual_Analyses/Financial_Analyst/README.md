# DIVE Method Analysis

**Task Overview**
Analyzing and applying the DIVE framework to the following business question:
"What is the impact of discounts on profitability?"

## D - Discover 
**"What percentage of discounts leads to negative profitability?"**

Using the provided discount data:
Discount           | TotalSales          | TotalProfit       | AvgProfit
0                            | $1,088,265.03 | $321,532.58   | $66.99
0.10                      | $54,369.35        | $9,029.18       | $96.06
0.20                      | $764,104.25     | $90,324.85     | $24.71
0.30                      | $103,226.66     | -$10,369.27   | -$45.68
0.50                      | $58,918.54        | -$20,506.43   | -$310.70
0.80                      | $16,963.76        | -$30,539.03   | -$101.80

* Discounts over 20% lead to negative average profitability, with deeper discounts (e.g., 30%-80%) yielding increasingly severe losses.
* Discounting erodes profitability at high levels, suggesting a need for strategic adjustments to discount policies to avoid losses.
* Discounts greater than 20% lead to negative profitability across various categories, totaling a loss of 135,369. Discounts over 20% represent 15.79% of the total sales but consistently result in negative profits. Conversely, discounts less than 20% contribute to 84.21% of total sales, yielding positive profitability with a total profit of 422,306. This highlights a correlation between higher discounts and financial losses, suggesting that high discounting adversely impacts overall profitability.

**Suggestions for Elimination or Adjustment:**
* **Revisit the >20% Discount Policy:**
Identify products where discounts significantly surpass profit margins. Consider reducing discounts on Furniture (Tables, Chairs, Bookcases, Furnishings), technology products (Machines, Phones), and office supplies (Binders, Appliances).
* **Stop selling items with persistent losses:**
Evaluate whether to discontinue categories that consistently result in losses, such as Office Supplies - Appliances and Furniture - Furnishings.
* **Optimize Pricing Strategy:**
Reassess price points and market competitiveness for items underperforming with high discount levels.
* **Focus on Products with Positive Profitability:**
Categories under <20% Discounts (e.g., Copiers, Phones, Accessories, Paper, Storage, Binders) show strong profitability; prioritize sales and marketing efforts towards these products.

* **Unlocked Potential:** 27% of Profitability Locked in Over-Discounting
High Impact of Over-Discounting: 27% of potential profitability is locked up in offering discounts greater than 20%, leading to losses totaling $135,369 across multiple categories.
Opportunity for Recovery: Reducing excessive discounting could potentially recover up to $160,087 in lost profitability, as indicated by the opportunity metric.

Focus Areas:
**Categories with Heavy Losses:** Furniture (Tables, Chairs, Bookcases, Furnishings), Technology (Machines, Phones), and Office Supplies (Binders, Appliances) are key areas impacted by over-discounting.
**Reassess >20% Discount Policy:** Revise discount thresholds to align with sustainable profit margins.
**Maximize Profit from Underperforming Categories:** Focus on optimizing sales strategies for products with high sales volume but negative profitability due to excessive discounts.
**Shift Marketing to Profitable Categories:** Invest efforts in marketing and promotions for products with <20% discounts that are already contributing positively to profitability.

## I - Investigate 
**Why Does This Pattern Exist?**
High discounts reduce the revenue/unit too much to cover fixed and variable costs.
Discounts may attract low-value customers who purchase lower-margin products.
How does profitability vary across customer segments for discounts above 20%?
               Discount         Segment         AvgProfitPerOrder            TotalProfit          TotalOrders
       0.30                   Corporate                 -$46.24                       -$2,543.27                55
         0.30                 Consumer                 -$48.01                        -$6,338.41              132
      0.30                 Home Office             -$37.19                       -$1,487.59                40
Losses are consistent across customer segments, though Corporate has a slightly better margin than Consumer.
Do high discounts affect profitability differently across product categories?
               Discount         | Category                           | AvgProfitPerSale
0.30                   | Technology                       | -$22.31
0.30                   | Office Supplies              | -$40.45
0.30                   | Furniture                           | -$50.67
Losses are most pronounced in Furniture, owing to lower margins even at regular prices.

Patterns reveal that:
Discounts across segments and categories hit profitability universally, but Furniture and Consumers seem most affected.
Fixed costs seem unmanageable at higher discount levels, implying inefficiencies in cost structure for discounted sales.


## V - Validate
What could make this conclusion wrong?
If customers incentivized by high discounts purchase more in the long term, the negative profitability on current transactions could eventually balance out.
What data limitations exist?
Lack of data on customer lifetime value (CLV) post-discount prevents understanding of long-term outcomes.
Limited visibility into variable costs for different categories could mean cost structures are uneven.
Perhaps higher discounts induce bulk orders, improving operational efficiency for certain customer types/products.
How does overall revenue change under high discounts (>30%)?
Discount     | TotalOrders      | TotalRevenue
0.30                      | 227                | $103,226.66
0.50                      | 66                   | $58,918.54
0.80                      | 300                 | $16,963.76

Revenue also decreases drastically beyond 20% discounts, refuting the notion of significant bulk-order incentives.

## E - Extend (Strategic Application)

Recommendations:
Adjust Discount Policy:
Cap discounts at 20%: Avoid deeper discounts that consistently result in unprofitable transactions. Maintain profitability margins.
Category-Specific Adjustments:
Technology: Continue targeted discounts for high-margin products with measured increases in discount levels.
Furniture: Reduce reliance on discounts as marketing drivers; focus on retention strategies based on customer loyalty.
Foster Customer Loyalty Without Deep Discounts:
Implement loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases with smaller incentives.
Offer personalized discounts to Corporate customers, leveraging higher average profit per customer.
Measure Impact: 
Quantify success through: Comparing pre- and post-policy profitability. Monitoring customer retention rate post-policy. Tracking trends in margins across categories.
Risks: Smaller discounts may deter lower-value customers or Bulk purchasers reliant on deep discounting.
Requires investment in customer analytics to ensure proper segmentation.


## Key Findings Summary
Discover: Discounts exceeding 20% lead to universal unprofitability across categories and customer segments.
Investigate: Factors include fixed/variable costs misaligned with discounted pricing, and deeper discounts driving a high volume of low-margin transactions.
Validate: Limited bulk-order incentive under high discounts, and insufficient CLV data further reinforce profitability erosion.
Extend: Implement discount caps, category-specific strategies, loyalty programs, and profitability-focused metrics.
Recommendations
Cap Discounts at 20% universally. Promote Technology-focused discounts. Reinforce Furniture pricing strategy through operational and retention strategies. Invest in CLV tracking tools for longer-term profitability analysis.
Additional Findings
Professionally summarizing, the analysis points to the following actionable insights:
Discount Strategy Adjustments: Avoid discounts greater than 20%; focus on optimizing discounts for profitability versus volume.
Category Profit Maximization: Focus on growing Technology and rethinking strategies for low-margin categories like Furniture.
Revenue Stabilization Tactics: Reduce reliance on seasonal peaks and ensure consistent sales throughout the year.
Regional Optimization: Amplify investments in West and East regions while assessing inefficiencies in Central.
Customer Segment Targeting: Prioritize Corporate clients for better profitability and revisit consumer-oriented resource allocation.
Addressing these challenges matters because they directly impact profitability, customer retention, and long-term financial stability.
